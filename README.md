This is the code for the paper published in IISE Transactions entitled "Profile monitoring based on transfer learning of multiple profiles with incomplete samples", authored by Amirhossein Fallahdizcheh and Chao Wang at the University of Iowa.

This document provides an demonstration of comparisons of the Trigonometircs signal in the paper with profile repetitions (5,4,6). In the paper, we run this code 10 times (10 different training data sets) to achieve the average value of ARL1 for each chart.
For different settings, following part can be modified.
n is the number of profiles
fun2 represents the target profile
num represents the number of repetition of each profile.
